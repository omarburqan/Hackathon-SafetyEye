### Introduction 
Hackathon project made using Cpp and Python based on raspberry pi 4 to detect safety tools in industrial.

## About 
Automatically detect the uses of Safety tools by analyzing the surveillance images. Based on the collected images, we Ô¨Årst detect the object of interest and further analyze whether the worker wears the Safety tools or not, by using computer vision and deep learning. 

#### Note : This operations  done at the  raspberry pi without streaming data all the time only when some employee break the law of safety. 

### Solution properties : 
cheap , privacy , effective , appropriate for multi platforms.
